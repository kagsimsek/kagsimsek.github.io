_on living_ <br>
 <br>
_living is no joke,_ <br>
_you must live with great seriousness_ <br>
_like a squirrel for example,_ <br>
_i mean, expecting nothing except and beyond living_ <br>
_i mean, living must be your whole occupation_ <br>
 <br>
_you must take living seriously,_ <br>
_i mean, to such an extent that,_ <br>
_for example your arms are tied from your back, your back is on the wall,_ <br>
_or in a laboratory with your white shirt, with your huge eyeglasses,_ <br>
_you must be able to die for people,_ <br>
_even for people you have never seen,_ <br>
_although nobody forced you to do this,_ <br>
_although you know that_ <br>
_living is the most real, most beautiful thing_ <br>
 <br>
_i mean, you must take living so seriously that_ <br>
_even when you are seventy, you must plant olive trees,_ <br>
_not because you think they will be left to your children,_ <br>
_because you don't believe in death although you are afraid of it_ <br>
_because, i mean, life weighs heavier_ <br>
 <br>
_suppose we are very sick, in need of surgey_ <br>
_i mean, there is the possibility that_ <br>
_we will never get up from the white table._ <br>
_although it is impossible not to feel the grief of passing away_ <br>
_somewhat too soon_ <br>
_we will still laught at the funny joke being told_ <br>
_we will look out of the window to see if it's raining_ <br>
_or we will wait impatiently_ <br>
_for the latest news from agencies_ <br>
 <br>
_suppose, for something worth fighting for,_ <br>
_suppose we are on the battlefield._ <br>
_over there, in the first attach, on the first day_ <br>
_we may fall on the ground on our face._ <br>
_we will know this with a somewhat strange grudge,_ <br>
_but we will still wonder like crazy_ <br>
_the result of the war that will possible last for years_ <br>
 <br>
_suppose we are in the jail,_ <br>
_age is close to fifty,_ <br>
_suppose there are still eighteen years until the iron door will open._ <br>
_still, we will live with the outer world,_ <br>
_with the people, animals, fights and winds_ <br>
_i mean, with the outer world beyond the walls_ <br>
 <br>
_i mean, however and wherever we are_ <br>
_we must live as if there is no death_ <br>
 <br>
_this earth will cool down,_ <br>
_a start among all the stars,_ <br>
_one of the tiniest,_ <br>
_i mean, a grain of glitter in the blue velvet,_ <br>
_i mean, this huge world of ours._ <br>
 <br>
_this earth will cool down one day,_ <br>
_not even like a pile of ice_ <br>
_or like a dead cloud._ <br>
_it will roll like an empty walnut _ <br>
_in the pure, endless darkness._ <br>
 <br>
_you must feel the pain of this now,_ <br>
_you must feel the grief right now._ <br>
_you must love this world so much_ <br>
_to be able to say "i lived"_ <br>
 <br>
