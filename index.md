_un peu de rêve_ <br>
_un peu d’amour_ <br>
_et puis bonjour!_ <br>

_la vie est vaine_ <br>
_un peu de peine_ <br>
_un peu d’espoir_ <br>
_et peu bonsoir!_ <br>

_on living_ <br>
 <br>
I <br>
 <br> 
Living is no laughing matter: <br>
	you must live with great seriousness <br>
		like a squirrel, for example— <br>
   I mean without looking for something beyond and above living, <br>
		I mean living must be your whole occupation. <br>
Living is no laughing matter: <br>
	you must take it seriously, <br>
	so much so and to such a degree <br>
   that, for example, your hands tied behind your back, <br>
                                            your back to the wall, <br>
   or else in a laboratory <br>
	in your white coat and safety glasses, <br>
	you can die for people— <br>
   even for people whose faces you’ve never seen, <br>
   even though you know living <br>
	is the most real, the most beautiful thing. <br>
I mean, you must take living so seriously <br>
   that even at seventy, for example, you’ll plant olive trees— <br>
   and not for your children, either, <br>
   but because although you fear death you don’t believe it, <br>
   because living, I mean, weighs heavier. <br>
 <br>
II <br>
 <br>
Let’s say we’re seriously ill, need surgery— <br>
which is to say we might not get up <br>
			from the white table. <br>
Even though it’s impossible not to feel sad <br>
			about going a little too soon, <br>
we’ll still laugh at the jokes being told, <br>
we’ll look out the window to see if it’s raining, <br>
or still wait anxiously <br>
		for the latest newscast. . .  <br>
Let’s say we’re at the front— <br>
	for something worth fighting for, say. <br>
There, in the first offensive, on that very day, <br>
	we might fall on our face, dead. <br>
We’ll know this with a curious anger, <br>
        but we’ll still worry ourselves to death <br>
        about the outcome of the war, which could last years. <br>
Let’s say we’re in prison <br>
and close to fifty, <br>
and we have eighteen more years, say, <br>
                        before the iron doors will open. <br>
We’ll still live with the outside, <br>
with its people and animals, struggle and wind— <br>
                                I  mean with the outside beyond the walls. <br>
I mean, however and wherever we are, <br>
        we must live as if we will never die. <br>
 <br>
III <br>
 <br>
This earth will grow cold, <br>
a star among stars <br>
               and one of the smallest, <br>
a gilded mote on blue velvet— <br>
	  I mean this, our great earth. <br>
This earth will grow cold one day, <br>
not like a block of ice <br>
or a dead cloud even  <br>
but like an empty walnut it will roll along <br>
	  in pitch-black space . . .  <br>
You must grieve for this right now <br>
—you have to feel this sorrow now— <br>
for the world must be loved this much <br>
                               if you’re going to say “I lived”. . . <br>
